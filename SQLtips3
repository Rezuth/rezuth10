Once you gather statistics using DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS, the statistics are stored in Oracle's data dictionary views. You can access these statistics using various data dictionary views. Here are some key views and queries to access the gathered statistics:

1. Table Statistics
You can view the statistics for your table in the USER_TABLES view (or ALL_TABLES and DBA_TABLES if you have the necessary privileges).

sql
Copiază codul
SELECT 
    table_name,
    num_rows,
    blocks,
    empty_blocks,
    avg_space,
    chain_cnt,
    avg_row_len,
    sample_size,
    last_analyzed
FROM 
    user_tables
WHERE 
    table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
2. Column Statistics
For detailed statistics about each column in the table, you can query the USER_TAB_COLUMNS view.

sql
Copiază codul
SELECT 
    column_name,
    num_distinct,
    low_value,
    high_value,
    density,
    num_nulls,
    avg_col_len,
    histogram
FROM 
    user_tab_columns
WHERE 
    table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
3. Index Statistics
To access the statistics of indexes on your table, you can use the USER_INDEXES view.

sql
Copiază codul
SELECT 
    index_name,
    table_name,
    num_rows,
    distinct_keys,
    leaf_blocks,
    clustering_factor,
    last_analyzed
FROM 
    user_indexes
WHERE 
    table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
4. Partition Statistics
If your table is partitioned, you can check the USER_TAB_PARTITIONS view for partition-specific statistics.

sql
Copiază codul
SELECT 
    table_name,
    partition_name,
    num_rows,
    blocks,
    empty_blocks,
    avg_space,
    chain_cnt,
    avg_row_len,
    sample_size,
    last_analyzed
FROM 
    user_tab_partitions
WHERE 
    table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
5. Example Combined Query
Here is an example combined query that fetches statistics from both the USER_TABLES and USER_TAB_COLUMNS views.

sql
Copiază codul
SELECT 
    t.table_name,
    t.num_rows AS table_num_rows,
    t.blocks AS table_blocks,
    t.avg_row_len AS table_avg_row_len,
    c.column_name,
    c.num_distinct AS col_num_distinct,
    c.low_value AS col_low_value,
    c.high_value AS col_high_value,
    c.avg_col_len AS col_avg_col_len
FROM 
    user_tables t
JOIN 
    user_tab_columns c ON t.table_name = c.table_name
WHERE 
    t.table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
Explanation of Key Columns in the Views
NUM_ROWS: Number of rows in the table or index.
BLOCKS: Number of data blocks in the table.
EMPTY_BLOCKS: Number of empty data blocks.
AVG_ROW_LEN: Average row length.
NUM_DISTINCT: Number of distinct values in the column.
LOW_VALUE: Lowest value in the column (in internal representation).
HIGH_VALUE: Highest value in the column (in internal representation).
DENSITY: Density of the column values.
NUM_NULLS: Number of null values in the column.
SAMPLE_SIZE: Size of the sample used to gather statistics.
LAST_ANALYZED: The date when the statistics were last gathered.
By querying these views, you can access detailed and up-to-date statistics about your table and its columns after running the DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS procedure.
