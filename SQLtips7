I have a problem in oracle sql: my table uses more memory than it should: 75G instead of 1G. The data is not of big types, and the indexeze are ok. I see that one of my partitions has block size 19000000 instead of 3000. Maybe this is the problem? Is it the partition?

The excessive memory usage of your Oracle SQL table could indeed be linked to the partition block size discrepancy you've observed. Here's a more detailed breakdown of potential causes and solutions:

Block Size Discrepancy:

If one of your partitions has a block size of 19,000,000 instead of the expected 3,000, this can lead to inefficient storage and excessive memory usage. Oracle stores data in blocks, and an abnormally large block size can cause Oracle to allocate more space than necessary, leading to the significant memory overhead you're experiencing.
Fragmentation:

Table or index fragmentation can cause excessive memory usage. When data is frequently inserted, updated, or deleted, it can lead to gaps and unused space within blocks. Running ANALYZE TABLE ... VALIDATE STRUCTURE or using tools like DBMS_SPACE can help diagnose fragmentation.
Unused Space:

If there are significant amounts of unused space in your table or partitions, this can contribute to the large memory footprint. The DBMS_SPACE.UNUSED_SPACE procedure can help identify unused space.
High Water Mark:

A high water mark (HWM) issue could also be a factor. The HWM indicates the highest point of space usage in a table. If your table had large amounts of data that were deleted, the HWM might still be high, leading Oracle to maintain more memory than necessary. You can check and adjust the HWM using ALTER TABLE ... SHRINK SPACE.
Table or Partition Statistics:

Ensure that your table and partition statistics are up-to-date. Use DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS to collect accurate statistics. Incorrect statistics can lead to suboptimal execution plans and memory usage.
PCTFREE and PCTUSED Settings:

These settings determine the space management within blocks. If PCTFREE is set too high, it leaves too much space reserved for updates, leading to inefficient block usage. Conversely, PCTUSED being too low can cause blocks to be underutilized. Check and adjust these settings as needed.
Steps to Diagnose and Fix:
Identify the Issue:

Run queries to check the actual block size and the space used by your partitions:
sql
Copiază codul
SELECT partition_name, block_size, bytes
FROM user_tab_partitions
WHERE table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
Analyze Table Structure:

Analyze the table to check for structural issues:
sql
Copiază codul
ANALYZE TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME VALIDATE STRUCTURE;
Check for Fragmentation:

Use DBMS_SPACE to check for fragmentation and unused space:
sql
Copiază codul
DECLARE
  total_blocks NUMBER;
  total_bytes NUMBER;
  unused_blocks NUMBER;
  unused_bytes NUMBER;
  last_used_extent_file_id NUMBER;
  last_used_extent_block_id NUMBER;
  last_used_block NUMBER;
BEGIN
  DBMS_SPACE.UNUSED_SPACE(
    segment_owner => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',
    segment_name => 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME',
    segment_type => 'TABLE',
    total_blocks => total_blocks,
    total_bytes => total_bytes,
    unused_blocks => unused_blocks,
    unused_bytes => unused_bytes,
    last_used_extent_file_id => last_used_extent_file_id,
    last_used_extent_block_id => last_used_extent_block_id,
    last_used_block => last_used_block
  );
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Total Blocks: ' || total_blocks);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Unused Blocks: ' || unused_blocks);
END;

Adjust Block Size:

If block size is indeed an issue, consider reorganizing the partition or table:
sql
Copiază codul
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME MOVE PARTITION partition_name
TABLESPACE your_tablespace
STORAGE (INITIAL 3K NEXT 3K);
Shrink Space:

Reduce the high water mark and reclaim unused space:
sql
Copiază codul
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
Update Statistics:

Gather statistics to ensure the optimizer has the latest information:
sql
Copiază codul
EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('YOUR_SCHEMA', 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME');
By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with excessive memory usage in your Oracle SQL table.
