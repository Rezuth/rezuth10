How to stop a background insert process in oracle sql with brute force for table x?
ChatGPT
To stop a background insert process in Oracle SQL, particularly if it's causing issues or you need to terminate it immediately, you can use the following steps. This involves identifying the session performing the insert and then killing that session. Here’s how to do it:

Identify the Session:
First, find the session that is performing the insert operation. You can use the following query to identify the session details based on the table involved:

sql
Copiază codul
SELECT s.sid, s.serial#, s.username, s.program, q.sql_text
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
WHERE LOWER(q.sql_text) LIKE '%insert%'
  AND LOWER(q.sql_text) LIKE '%table_x%';
Replace table_x with the actual name of your table. This query searches for any active sessions running an INSERT statement on the specified table.

Kill the Session:
Once you have identified the session (SID and SERIAL#), you can kill the session using the following command:

sql
Copiază codul
ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION 'sid,serial#';
Replace sid and serial# with the values obtained from the previous query. For example, if the SID is 123 and SERIAL# is 4567, you would run:

sql
Copiază codul
ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION '123,4567';
Immediate Kill (if needed):
If the above command does not immediately terminate the session (the session might be marked for kill and could take some time to be terminated), you can use the following command to forcefully and immediately kill the session:

sql
Copiază codul
ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION 'sid,serial#' IMMEDIATE;
Again, replace sid and serial# with the appropriate values.

Example Scenario
Let’s say you identified a session with SID 100 and SERIAL# 200, running an INSERT statement on table_x. The commands would be:

Identify the session:

sql
Copiază codul
SELECT s.sid, s.serial#, s.username, s.program, q.sql_text
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
WHERE LOWER(q.sql_text) LIKE '%insert%'
  AND LOWER(q.sql_text) LIKE '%table_x%';
Kill the session:

sql
Copiază codul
ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION '100,200';
If immediate termination is required:

sql
Copiază codul
ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION '100,200' IMMEDIATE;
Note: Use these commands with caution, as killing sessions can lead to uncommitted data being lost and might have other implications on database integrity and application behavior.
