WITH RECURSIVE date_sequence AS (
  SELECT :input_date AS dt FROM dual
  UNION ALL
  SELECT dt - 1 FROM date_sequence WHERE dt - 1 >= (SELECT MIN(XDAY) FROM A)
)
SELECT A.NAME
FROM A
JOIN date_sequence ON A.XDAY = date_sequence.dt
WHERE ROWNUM = 1;

Using CONNECT BY:

SELECT A.NAME
FROM A
WHERE A.XDAY = (
  SELECT MAX(XDAY) 
  FROM A
  WHERE XDAY <= :input_date
  CONNECT BY PRIOR XDAY = XDAY - 1
  START WITH XDAY = :input_date
);
Using PL/SQL Loop:

DECLARE
  v_date DATE := :input_date;
  v_name VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
  LOOP
    SELECT NAME INTO v_name FROM A WHERE XDAY = v_date;
    EXIT WHEN v_name IS NOT NULL;
    v_date := v_date - 1;
  END LOOP;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name: ' || v_name);
END;

Using Inline View with Row Number:

SELECT NAME
FROM (
  SELECT NAME, XDAY, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY XDAY DESC) AS rn
  FROM A
  WHERE XDAY <= :input_date
)
WHERE rn = 1;

Using Cross Join with Subquery:

SELECT A.NAME
FROM A
CROSS JOIN (
  SELECT MAX(XDAY) AS last_date 
  FROM A 
  WHERE XDAY <= :input_date
) AS sub
WHERE A.XDAY = sub.last_date;
