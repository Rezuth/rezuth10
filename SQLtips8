So I think the problem is the HWM. I deleted a set of tens of thousand rows, and maybe the blocks remained. Will 'ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;' do the trick?
ChatGPT
Yes, the ALTER TABLE ... SHRINK SPACE CASCADE command is designed to address issues with the high water mark (HWM) and can help reclaim unused space that remains after large deletions.

Here's what this command does:

Shrink Space: This operation compacts the table by moving the rows around to eliminate free space and reduce the HWM. This can help to reclaim the space previously occupied by the deleted rows.
Cascade: This ensures that the shrink operation is applied to all dependent objects, such as indexes, thereby ensuring that the entire table structure is optimized.
Before proceeding, there are a few points to consider:

Online Operation: In Oracle 11g and above, the SHRINK SPACE operation can be done online, meaning it can be performed while the table is accessible. However, there might be a performance impact during the operation.
Row Movement: Ensure that row movement is enabled for the table. You can enable row movement with:
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;
Steps to Perform Shrink Operation
Enable Row Movement:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;
Shrink the Table:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
Example
Here’s how you can do it in a full example:

sql
Copy code
-- Enable row movement for the table
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

-- Shrink the table and associated objects
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
Verifying the Operation
After running the shrink operation, you can check the space usage and HWM to confirm the space has been reclaimed:

sql
Copy code
-- Check the space usage before and after the shrink operation
SELECT segment_name, segment_type, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM user_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
Additional Considerations
Indexes: The CASCADE option will handle indexes, but you might want to rebuild indexes separately if you notice any performance issues.
Monitoring: Monitor the performance impact during the shrink operation, especially if you're performing it on a production system.
By following these steps, the SHRINK SPACE CASCADE command should help you reclaim the unused space, thereby reducing the overall memory footprint of your table.

What will happen to the existing data in the table?
ChatGPT
Performing an ALTER TABLE ... SHRINK SPACE CASCADE operation on your table will compact the table by reorganizing its data blocks to eliminate unused space and reduce the high water mark (HWM). Here’s what happens to the existing data during this process:

Row Movement:

The shrink operation may move rows within the table to create contiguous free space and compact the table. This is why enabling row movement is necessary before performing the shrink operation.
Data Integrity:

Oracle ensures data integrity during the shrink process. The operation is designed to be safe, and data will not be lost or corrupted. The database keeps track of row movements internally.
Performance Impact:

There can be a performance impact while the shrink operation is in progress, especially if the table is large or heavily used. The operation is designed to be online (in Oracle 11g and later), meaning it can be performed while the table is accessible, but some DML operations may experience slower performance during the shrink process.
Index Maintenance:

When using the CASCADE option, the operation will also adjust the indexes associated with the table. Indexes will be maintained to reflect the new row locations, ensuring they remain valid and optimized.
Table Availability:

The table remains available for read and write operations during the shrink process, although the performance might be temporarily affected.
Steps to Perform Shrink Operation and Maintain Data Integrity
Enable Row Movement:

This allows Oracle to move rows around during the shrink process.
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;
Perform the Shrink Operation:

This command will compact the table and its associated objects.
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
Example
sql
Copy code
-- Enable row movement for the table
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

-- Shrink the table and associated objects
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
Verification
After the operation, you can verify that the space has been reclaimed and check the new high water mark by inspecting the segment space usage:

sql
Copy code
-- Check the space usage before and after the shrink operation
SELECT segment_name, segment_type, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM user_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
Post-Shrink Considerations
Statistics: It’s a good practice to gather fresh statistics on the table after performing a shrink operation to ensure the optimizer has the most up-to-date information.

sql
Copy code
EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('YOUR_SCHEMA', 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME');
Monitoring: Keep an eye on the performance of the table and its indexes after the operation to ensure everything is functioning optimally.

By following these steps, you can safely shrink your table to reclaim unused space while maintaining the integrity of your existing data.

I meant about the select operations. Can I operate on my table and use the existing data? I have 75000 rows of data right now. Can I expect to remain with that?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can continue to perform SELECT operations on your table and use the existing data during and after the shrink operation. The ALTER TABLE ... SHRINK SPACE CASCADE command is designed to be an online operation, meaning it can be executed while the table is still accessible and operational for both read and write activities. Here are some key points to address your concerns:

Data Availability and Integrity
Existing Data:

The existing data in your table (the 75,000 rows) will remain intact. The shrink operation does not delete or alter the data itself; it merely reorganizes the storage of that data to eliminate unused space.
Select Operations:

You can continue to perform SELECT operations on your table during the shrink process. The table remains available for read operations, and the data will be accurate and accessible.
Consistency:

Oracle maintains data consistency and integrity during the shrink operation. Any ongoing transactions and queries will see a consistent view of the data, as Oracle handles the row movements internally.
Performance Considerations:

While SELECT operations will continue to work, you might notice some performance impact during the shrink process, as the database will be actively compacting and moving rows around. This impact is usually minimal but can vary based on the size of the table and the workload.
Steps for Safe Shrinking
Enable Row Movement:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;
Perform the Shrink Operation:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
Example
sql
Copy code
-- Enable row movement for the table
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

-- Shrink the table and associated objects
ALTER TABLE YOUR_TABLE_NAME SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
Verification
After the shrink operation, verify the row count and ensure all data is intact:

sql
Copy code
-- Check the row count to ensure no data loss
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM YOUR_TABLE_NAME;

-- Check the space usage before and after the shrink operation
SELECT segment_name, segment_type, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM user_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
Post-Shrink Considerations
Statistics: Update the statistics of your table to help the optimizer make the best decisions:
sql
Copy code
EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('YOUR_SCHEMA', 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME');
By following these steps, you can safely perform the shrink operation while ensuring that your existing data remains accessible and intact. The shrink operation will help optimize the storage without compromising the availability or integrity of your data.
